How would you pitch your game in one line?
"The game is like Subway Surfers with the addition of transitioning between parallel worlds, each offering new abilities and challenges."

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?
The key mechanic is the ability to transition between parallel worlds, each with unique environments, obstacles, and power-ups. As the player progresses, they transform into stronger forms that unlock new abilities (such as double jumping, flying, or cloaking), keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting. The transition between worlds is smooth and dynamic, maintaining player engagement while encouraging adaptation to new mechanics.

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)
Players automatically run through various worlds filled with obstacles (such as cars, robots, fiery pits, etc.). The main goal is to surviveâ€”avoid obstacles, collect power-ups, and transition between worlds. By collecting specific items or reaching certain milestones, players unlock gateways to new worlds, gaining new abilities with each transition. Each new world changes the rules: gravity might change, new enemies appear, and the player must adjust their strategies to survive. Players are rewarded by progressing through new worlds, transformations, and unlocking additional abilities.

Worlds in the Game:

1. Earth World (Base World):
Similar to regular cities, where the player jumps over cars and barriers. After collecting a certain number of points, they unlock the gateway to the next world.


2. Space World:
Low gravity allows for longer jumps. Some platforms disappear and reappear at specific intervals. The player can transform into a fast alien creature.


3. Hell World:
Fire erupts from the ground, making some areas impassable. The player can transform into a fiery beast that can walk through lava. Walls close rapidly, making timing crucial.


4. Cyberpunk World:
Filled with robots and moving platforms. The player transforms into an advanced robot capable of double jumping and boosting at high speeds. They must avoid lasers and rotating gears.


5. Ocean World (New):
This world is filled with water and sea creatures. The player can swim through the waters, navigating strong currents and deep underwater obstacles like rocks and giant fish. Water currents can be used to speed up movement or "water dash" through barriers.



How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
To keep players engaged for 30 minutes or longer, the game will include:

A variety of constantly changing environments (Earth, Space, Hell, Cyberpunk, Ocean) to avoid the feeling of repetition.

Increasing difficulty and complexity of levels to challenge players' reflexes and strategic thinking.

Daily/weekly challenges (such as collecting specific items, using certain abilities) to encourage player interaction.

Power-ups and abilities that give the player temporary boosts to help them navigate tough sections.

A variety of costumes and upgrades that players can unlock, motivating them to progress.


When players reach certain scores, they unlock new weapons or stronger forms for the character.

The player aims to save the world in this game, which gives them a sense of power and enhances their enjoyment of the gameplay.
